Title: Reverse engineering of molecular regulatory networks with
        qp-graphs
Version: 1.21.11
Author: R. Castelo and A. Roverato
Description: q-order partial correlation graphs, or qp-graphs for
        short, are undirected Gaussian graphical Markov models built
        from q-order partial correlations. They are useful for learning
        undirected graphical Gaussian Markov models from data sets
        where the number of random variables p exceeds the available
        sample size n as, for instance, in the case of microarray data
        where they can be employed to reverse engineer a molecular
        regulatory network.
